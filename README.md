# Enigma Repository

This repository corresponds to a series of open source code developed in python and c++ for systems based on ROS and other platforms. Each package will have its execution requirements or possible libraries necessary for the construction and execution of these.

## Starting üöÄ

_To run most scripts you need to have them in a ROS workspace,downloading the respective package._

### Pre-requirements üìã

Needed

```
Python 3.7 and 2.7
Ubuntu 18.04 or higher 
ROS melodic or Noetic 
STM32 CubeIDE version 1.4 or higher
```
Download links
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- [STM32 CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)

Recommend to use a Code Editor
- [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)
- [PyCharm](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-pycharm-on-ubuntu-20-04-linux-desktop)


### Installation üîß

_The first step is to clone the repository to a folder of your choice._

_Look for the folder that you want to beand in the terminal_

```
git clone https://github.com/DuneV/glowing-enigma.git
```

_Second, enter to the folder_

```
cd /folderle_of_preference
```

_Third, copy this file  with the next command (case package)_

```
cp avr /source_folder(package)  /destination_folder(workspace_ws/src)
```

## Run Test‚öôÔ∏è

_Enter to your workspace_

```
catkin_make or catkin_build
```

### Troubleshooting üî©

_You may not have all the necessary libraries and packages, you can download a package manager like pip to the python libraries (pynput, pytteseract, rosserial, cv2, cvbridge, threading, etc.) or sudo apt-get install ros_distribution-package-ersion_

```
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic/melodic-realsense-camera
```

### STM32 execution ‚å®Ô∏è

1. Open STMCubeIDE editor
2. Open the file as a new project on workspace
3. Adjust the [STM32HardwareFile](https://github.com/DuneV/glowing-enigma/blob/main/CubeIDE_Project/Stm_ros_L4/Core/Inc/STM32Hardware.h) for your board.
4. Upload the project.
5. run the rosserial_python, and the subcribers/publisher are going to with STM.
